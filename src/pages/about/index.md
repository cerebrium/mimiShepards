### AKC Verified and Documented

Our dogs have been registered and verified to be of the highest quality by the AKC. We can personally guaruntee that the dogs you are looking at are the healthiest pups around, and the fluffiest!

### Breeding Values

We love our pups from the day they're born. We make sure that the mom has an enclosure that is both safe and warm and easily accessible to us and not to anything else. We love our mom dogs and when they aren't breeding they are hiking and swimming. This ensures that the puppies have a highest quality genes and have the best chance of surviving.

<!-- ### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog. -->
