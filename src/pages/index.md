    We take the time to care for our dogs from the youngest age to guaruntee
    that they are as healthy as can be.  We don't breed more often than we
    should, or put undo stress on our mom dogs. We love each and every pup we
    see, and take care of them to ensure when they go to their new homes they
    will have the best possible chance for happiness.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That's why we're meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee's
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
